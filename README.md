
# Blog Starter Project

This repository contains a comprehensive, backend for a modern blogging platform, built with Go. It follows a clean architecture pattern and includes features like user authentication, blog and comment management, AI-powered content assistance, and efficient data handling with caching and background workers.

## Architecture

The project is structured using a clean architecture approach to ensure separation of concerns, maintainability, and testability.

-   **`Domain`**: Contains the core business logic, entities (structs), and interfaces that define the contracts for repositories and use cases. This layer is independent of any framework or external technology.
-   **`Usecases`**: Implements the application-specific business rules by orchestrating the flow of data between the `Domain` and `Repository` layers.
-   **`Repository`**: The data access layer. This implementation uses MongoDB to persist data and an in-memory LRU cache to optimize read operations.
-   **`Delivery`**: The presentation layer, responsible for handling HTTP requests and responses. It uses the Gin web framework to define API routes and controllers.
-   **`Infrastructure`**: Holds all the external concerns like database connections, JWT services, OAuth configurations, password hashing, email services, and background workers.

## Key Features

-   **User Management & Authentication**:
    -   Secure user registration with email verification.
    -   Local login using JWT (Access & Refresh Tokens).
    -   Google OAuth2 for social login.
    -   Forgot/Reset password functionality.
    -   User profile creation and updates.
    -   Role-based access control (User vs. Admin).

-   **Blog & Comment System**:
    -   Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for blog posts and comments.
    -   Like/Dislike system for blog posts.
    -   Popularity score calculation based on views, likes, and comments.
    -   Efficient pagination and sorting for blogs (latest, oldest, popular) and comments.
    -   Advanced blog filtering by tags and date ranges.
    -   Full-text search functionality for blog content.

-   **AI-Powered Content Assistance**:
    -   Integrates with Google's Gemini AI to provide content editing and SEO suggestions for blog writers.

-   **Performance & Scalability**:
    -   In-memory LRU caching for frequently accessed blogs and comments to reduce database load.
    -   Asynchronous background worker to refresh blog popularity scores without blocking API requests.
    -   Optimized database queries with indexing.

-   **Configuration**:
    -   Flexible configuration management using Viper, supporting both `config.yaml` and environment variables.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

-   Go (version 1.24 or later)
-   MongoDB instance (local or Atlas)
-   A Google Cloud project for OAuth2 credentials.
-   A Google Gemini API Key.
-   An application-specific password for your email account (for sending verification emails).

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/gedyzed/blog-starter-project.git
    cd blog-starter-project
    ```

2.  **Configure Environment Variables**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory. You can copy the structure from `Infrastructure/config/env.example`, but note that the example file is empty. Your `.env` file should look like this:

    ```env
    # Application
    PORT=8080
    APP_URL="http://localhost:8080"

    # Database
    MONGO_URL="<your_mongodb_connection_string>"

    # Authentication (generate strong random strings)
    AUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN_KEY="<your_super_secret_access_key>"
    AUTH_REFRESH_TOKEN_KEY="<your_super_secret_refresh_key>"

    # Google OAuth2
    OAUTH_CLIENT_ID="<your_google_client_id>"
    OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET="<your_google_client_secret>"
    OAUTH_REDIRECT_URL="http://localhost:8080/oauth/callback"

    # Email Service (for user verification & password reset)
    EMAIL_SENDER_EMAIL="<your_email@example.com>"
    EMAIL_APP_PASSWORD="<your_email_app_password>"
    EMAIL_SMTP_HOST="smtp.gmail.com"
    EMAIL_SMTP_PORT="587"

    # Generative AI
    GEMINI_API_KEY="<your_google_gemini_api_key>"
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies**
    ```sh
    go mod tidy
    ```

4.  **Run the Application**
    ```sh
    go run ./Delivery/main.go
    ```
    The server will start on the port specified in your `.env` file (default: `8080`).
